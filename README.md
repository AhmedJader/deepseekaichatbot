# DeepSeek AI Chatbot

This project is a simple AI chatbot application built using Next.js, React, and the OpenAI API. The chatbot allows users to interact with an AI assistant that responds to their messages.

## Installation

To install the project, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AhmedJader/deepseekaichatbot
cd deepseekaichatbot
```

```bash
npm i
```

## .env.local File

```bash
echo "deepseek_api_key=your_api_key_here" > .env.local
```

THIS CREATES A .ENV.LOCAL FILE IN THE ROOT OF THE PROJECT WHERE YOU CAN PUT YOUR API KEY
THE FILE ALREADY PASTES THE API KEY LINE FOR YOU, JUST CHANGE THE API KEY TO YOURS

## Usage

To start the chatbot, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The chatbot will start listening for user input and respond accordingly.

## Features

The chatbot has the following features:

- User input: The chatbot will listen for user input and respond accordingly.
- AI response: The chatbot will use the DeepSeek API to generate responses to user input.

## IMPORTANT

You need to have the DeepSeek API key set in the .env file. You can get your key from the DeepSeek website.

The purpose of this project is to simply be one of the million AI API's out there that you can utilize quickly.
I have created one for Cohere-API, OpenAi-API and now DeepSeek-API. I just wanted to see how it works.

uhh, yea enjoy the chatbot. I tried my best to make it as simplistic as possible to follow with comments written detailing EXACTLY what each line is SUPPOSED TO DO.
